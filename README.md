# GoUS: International Student Connectivity Platform

## Project Overview
GoUS is a specialized web platform designed to simplify the process of selecting mobile phone plans for international students arriving in the United States. Recognizing the complexity of the US telecommunications market and the immediate connectivity needs of new students, GoUS provides a streamlined, transparent, and visually engaging interface to compare carriers and find the optimal plan.

## Key Features

### Visual Experience & Design Language
The platform adopts a modern, high-fidelity design aesthetic inspired by Google's latest design language (Gemini/Antigravity). Key visual elements include:
*   **Dynamic Gradients**: A custom-engineered, multi-color gradient animation on the "Guide" headline that flows seamlessly to represent intelligence and connectivity.
*   **Micro-Interactions**: Refined hover states on navigation and action buttons, featuring animated underlines and subtle layout shifts to provide tactile feedback without clutter.
*   **Clean Typography**: Utilization of Figtree and Plus Jakarta Sans to ensure high readability and a professional, trustworthy appearance.

### Core Functionality
*   **Carrier Comparison**: A structured comparison matrix allowing students to evaluate major US carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc.) based on price, data limits, and network coverage.
*   **Simplified Navigation**: A user-centric information architecture that prioritizes "Getting Started" and "Viewing Plans," reducing the cognitive load for users unfamiliar with US terminology.
*   **Responsive Layout**: A fully responsive design ensuring accessibility across desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack
*   **Framework**: Next.js (React)
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **Animation**: Framer Motion & CSS Keyframes
*   **Icons**: Lucide React
